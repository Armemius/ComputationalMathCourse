## Laboratory work 3 - Numerical integration [CLI]

Program that compute value of specified definite integral and mathematical error using several methods including:

- Left rectangles method
- Right rectangles method
- Central rectangles method
- Trapezoid method
- Simpson method

## Laboratory work 4 - Function approximation [WEB]

Program that compute different approximation functions for a given table of data, the program computes:

- Linear approximation
- Quadratic approximation
- Cubic approximation
- Exponential approximation
- Logarithmic approximation
- Power approximation

And RMSE and determination coefficient (R^2) for all variants of the approximation functions and based on that finds the best approximation
